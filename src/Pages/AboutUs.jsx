<p>6 years on, Blockout has provided numerous other upcoming brands, independent creatives, musicians and established institutions with a dedicated print and garment production service.</p>


<p>Today we run a fully equipped print space, with the ability to produce a variety of garment customizations. We are also committed to printing artworks on paper and have also started producing customized tufted carpets with the goal of promoting and sharing designs by the creative community in and around Kathmandu.</p>

<p>To provide a hassle free service we also supply custom made garments including t-shirts, hoodies, joggers and sweatshirts to name a few, which are produced directly by our team.</p>
